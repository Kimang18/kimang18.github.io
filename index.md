Currently, I am a PhD student supervised by Nicolas GAST and Bruno GAUJAL at University of Grenoble Alpes and I work in Polaris team of LIG and INRIA. My PhD project is about using Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms in Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem, in which each arm is a Markov Decision Process (MDP). This problem can be considered as a MDP having a state size that is exponential in the number of arms; which is known as a curse of dimensionality. Our goal is to investigate whether  RL algorithms can utilize the structure of MAB problem to escape from the curse of dimensionality during the learning.
