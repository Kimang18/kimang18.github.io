Currently, I am an officer at the __Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology, and Innovation of Cambodia__.
I was a PhD student supervised by [Nicolas Gast](https://polaris.imag.fr/nicolas.gast/) and [Bruno Gaujal](https://team.inria.fr/polaris/members/bruno-gaujal/) at __University of Grenoble Alpes of France__.
My PhD project was about using Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms in Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem, in which each arm is a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
This problem can be considered as a _MDP having a state size that is exponential in the number of arms_.
This is known as _the curse of dimensionality_.
Our goal is to investigate whether RL algorithms can _utilize the structure of MAB problem to escape from the curse of dimensionality during the learning_.
